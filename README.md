# Darwin device

The application simulates how Darwin's thesis on evolution works, Darwin claims that living beings, man included,
came from mutual ancestors that have changed over the years. Thus, existing species have evolved from simpler species that living in the past.
Imagine that years ago somewhere in England there were white butterflies, they survived well during the winter, 
as they camouflaged themselves in the snow. 
Sometimes, some butterflies were born darker than others due to some changes in genetics (does not matter). 
This butterflies had been predator's victims because they have been unable to camouflag in the snow. 
Over the years with the development of industries, pollution increased a lot, so it didn't snow there anymore, so the white butterflies
they couldn't camouflage themselves, and those who were born darker could and would survive

# How it works?

To simulate, let's go follow this steps:

* We need insert a objective (In the Darwin's thesis this would be a need that this living being need to adaptate);
* Then we need to generate a parent (White butterfly. This will be the actual condition of this living being);
* We choose the quantity of sons per generation; (The quantity of descendents that living being will have per breeding period);
* And the we choose the mutation degree (This referes how much the DNA can be changed in relation of ASC table. DNA will be the letters of parent);

After choosing these options and booting the system, he will gave the result. Depending of quantity of mutation degree and the quantity of sons has a possibility that objective can not be reached (extinction).
